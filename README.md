# DES105_Submission
Submission for DES105 module - Lucinda Shale (2204108)

In this coursework, I have demonstrated my understanding of programming through the development of a
simple 2D computer game.

I have created and presented simple computer game that I am familiar with - Pong. I did this using the Unity Engine and C# programming language. I have programmed a computer game with user interaction and some gameplay (LO1, LO2) and have used programming concepts which I am able to describe (LO1, LO3).

I have made use of core programming concepts (LO1), have written a simple program for a specific purpose (LO2) and have communicated effectively about the practice of programming (LO3).
