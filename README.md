# DES105_Submission
Submission for DES105 module - Lucinda Shale (2204108)

Introduction

In this coursework, I have demonstrated my understanding of programming through the development of a simple 2D computer game by re-creating a computer game that I am familiar with - Pong. I did this using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. 

How to Play: 

Use the up and down arrows on the keyboard to move the player paddle which is located on the left side of the screen. The aim is to use the paddle to stop the ball from hitting the left side of the screen which would result in the enemy/computer scoring a goal against you resulting in you losing the game. You should do this until the enemy/computer misses by allowing the ball to hit the right hand side of the screen resulting in you scoring a goal and therefore winning the game. 

Learning Outcomes: 

I have programmed a computer game with user interaction and some gameplay (LO1, LO2) and have used programming concepts which I am able to describe (LO1, LO3).

I have made use of core programming concepts (LO1), have written a simple program for a specific purpose (LO2) and have communicated effectively about the practice of programming (LO3).
